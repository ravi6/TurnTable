# TurnTable
Reviving Retro Turntable

### Preamble
![hello](./figs/lp.png)

I was asked if I could fix the above Turntable which refused to turn on and play 
any records. At the start I thought it should be reasonably simple fix given there
is no power to the unit. I first opened up the unit to find the electronics in it
is fairly modern with PCB that is significantly dense with SMD components.
